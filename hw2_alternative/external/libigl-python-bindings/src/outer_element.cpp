const char *ds_outer_vertex = R"igl_Qu8mg5v7(

Find a vertex that is reachable from infinite without crossing any faces.
Such vertex is called "outer vertex."

Precondition: The input mesh must have all self-intersection resolved and
no duplicated vertices.  See cgal::remesh_self_intersections.h for how to
obtain such input.

Parameters
----------
V  #V by 3 list of vertex positions
F  #F by 3 list of triangle indices into V
I  #I list of facets to consider

Returns
-------
v_index  index of outer vertex
A  #A list of facets incident to the outer vertex

const char *ds_outer_edge = R"igl_Qu8mg5v7(

Find an edge that is reachable from infinity without crossing any faces.
   Such edge is called "outer edge."

   Precondition: The input mesh must have all self-intersection resolved and
   no duplicated vertices.  The correctness of the output depends on the fact
   that there is no edge overlap.  See cgal::remesh_self_intersections.h for
   how to obtain such input.

Parameters
----------
V  #V by 3 list of vertex positions
F  #F by 3 list of triangle indices into V
I  #I list of facets to consider

Returns
-------

v1 index of the first end point of outer edge
v2 index of the second end point of outer edge
A  #A list of facets incident to the outer edge

const char *ds_outer_facet = R"igl_Qu8mg5v7(

Find a facet that is reachable from infinity without crossing any faces.
Such facet is called "outer facet."

Precondition: The input mesh must have all self-intersection resolved.  I.e
there is no duplicated vertices, no overlapping edge and no intersecting
faces (the only exception is there could be topologically duplicated faces).
See cgal::remesh_self_intersections.h for how to obtain such input.

Parameters
----------
V  #V by 3 list of vertex positions
F  #F by 3 list of triangle indices into V
N  #N by 3 list of face normals
I  #I list of facets to consider

Returns
-------
f  Index of the outer facet.
flipped  true iff the normal of f points inwards.
