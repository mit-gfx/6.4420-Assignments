 HAUSDORFF compute the Hausdorff distance between mesh (VA,FA) and mesh
   (VB,FB). This is the

   d(A,B) = max ( max min d(a,b) , max min d(b,a) )
                  a∈A b∈B          b∈B a∈A

Parameters
----------
     VA  #VA by 3 list of vertex positions
     FA  #FA by 3 list of face indices into VA
     VB  #VB by 3 list of vertex positions
     FB  #FB by 3 list of face indices into VB

Returns
-------
    d  hausdorff distance
    pair  2 by 3 list of "determiner points" so that pair(1,:) is from A
    and pair(2,:) is from B

Notes
-----
   Known issue: This is only computing max(min(va,B),min(vb,A)). This is
   better than max(min(va,Vb),min(vb,Va)). This (at least) is missing
   "edge-edge" cases like the distance between the two different
   triangulations of a non-planar quad in 3D. Even simpler, consider the
   Hausdorff distance between the non-convex, block letter V polygon (with 7
   vertices) in 2D and its convex hull. The Hausdorff distance is defined by
   the midpoint in the middle of the segment across the concavity and some
   non-vertex point _on the edge_ of the V.
